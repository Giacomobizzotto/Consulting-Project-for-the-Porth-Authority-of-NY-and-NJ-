# Port Authority Bus Terminal Passenger Prediction (2025-2030)

This project was developed in collaboration with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the University of New Haven. The goal of the project was to support data-driven infrastructure planning for the Port Authority Bus Terminal by forecasting passenger volumes and analyzing travel behavior trends from 2025 to 2030.

The project addressed five key business questions:
1. **Forecast passenger volumes from 2025 to 2030** to support temporary staging facility planning.
2. **Identify the most significant factors affecting passenger demand**, including temporal and weather variables.
3. **Forecast ridership by individual carrier**, accounting for unique recovery and seasonal patterns.
4. **Determine the busiest periods for the staging facilities**, providing forecasts by week, month, and year.
5. **Compare post-COVID projections to 2019 levels**, assessing long-term shifts in transportation behavior.

A combination of advanced forecasting models (ETS, ARIMA, Prophet, TSLM) and data visualization tools (Power BI) were used to deliver actionable insights for the Port Authority's strategic decision-making.

The project involved extensive data cleaning, integration from multiple databases, and the creation of interactive dashboards to visualize forecasts and key trends.
